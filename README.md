📡 Network Segmentation and Inter-VLAN Routing Project

📖 Project Overview
This project demonstrates network segmentation and inter-VLAN routing using Cisco Packet Tracer.
It involves creating multiple VLANs, configuring a router for inter-VLAN routing, and applying Access Control Lists (ACLs) to enforce security policies between departments.

🏗️ Network Design
Departments/VLANs:

VLAN 10 – Sales (192.168.10.0/24)

VLAN 20 – IT (192.168.20.0/24)

VLAN 30 – HR (192.168.30.0/24)

VLAN 40 – Marketing (192.168.40.0/24)

Key Devices:

1x Cisco Router (Inter-VLAN Routing)

5x Cisco Switches (VLAN Management)

Multiple End Devices (3 PCs in each VLAN)

🔧 Configuration Details


Switch Configuration:

VLAN creation and port assignment

Trunk link configuration between switches and router


Router Configuration:

Subinterfaces for each VLAN (GigabitEthernet0/0/0.10, .20, .30, .40)

Encapsulation with dot1Q

IP addressing for each VLAN


Security (ACLs):

Extended ACLs applied inbound on router subinterfaces

Controlled access between departments (e.g., only IT can be reached by others)


🛠️ Technologies Used
